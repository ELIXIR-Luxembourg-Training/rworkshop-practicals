```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(datasauRus)
library(knitr)
ds_dozen <- datasaurus_dozen
```

This guided practical will demonstrate that the **tidyverse** allows to compute summary statistics and visualize datasets efficiently.
This dataset is already stored in a **tidy** `tibble`, cleaning steps will come in future practicals.

## `datasauRus` package

- check if you have the package `datasauRus` installed

```{r}
library(datasauRus)
```

- should return nothing. If `there is no package called ‘datasauRus’` appears, it means that the package needs 
to be installed. Use this:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("datasauRus")
```

## Explore the dataset

Since we are dealing with a `tibble`, we can type

```{r, eval = FALSE}
datasaurus_dozen
```


only the first **10** rows are displayed.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
datasaurus_dozen %>%
  head(10) %>%
  kable()
```

##### What are the dimensions of this dataset? Rows and columns?

- **base** version, using either `dim()`, `ncol()` and `nrow()`

```{r, solution = TRUE}
# dim() returns the dimensions of the data frame, i.e number of rows and columns
dim(datasaurus_dozen)
# ncol() only number of columns
ncol(datasaurus_dozen)
# nrow() only number of rows
nrow(datasaurus_dozen)
```

- **tidyverse** version

```{block, solution = TRUE}
nothing to be done, a `tibble` display its dimensions, starting by a comment ('#' character)
```

##### Assign the `datasaurus_dozen` to the `ds_dozen` name. This aims at populating the **Global Environment**

```{r}
ds_dozen <- datasaurus_dozen
```

##### Using Rstudio, those dimensions are now also reported within the interface, where?

```{block, solution = TRUE}
in the Environment panel -> Global Environment
```

## How many datasets are present?

- **base** version

```{block, opts.label = "tip"}
You want to count the number of **unique** elements in the column **dataset**. The character `$` applied to a data.frame subset the column and convert the 2D structure to 1D, _i. e_ a vector.
The function **length()** returns the length of a vector, such as the unique elements
```

```{r, solution = TRUE}
length(unique(ds_dozen$dataset))
```

- **tidyverse** version

```{r}
# n_distinct counts the unique elements in a given vector.
# we use summarise to return only the desired column named n here.
# we use English verbs and no subsetting characters, nor we change dimensions (keep a tibble)
summarise(ds_dozen, n = n_distinct(dataset))
```

- even better, compute and display the number of lines per `dataset`

```{block, opts.label = "tip"}
the function `count` in `dplyr` does the `group_by()` by the specified column + `summarise(n = n())` which returns the number of observation per defined group.
```

```{r, solution = TRUE}
count(ds_dozen, dataset)
```


## Check summary statistics per dataset

##### Compute the mean of the `x` & `y` column. For this, you need to `group_by()` the appropriate column and then `summarise()`

```{block, opts.label = "tip"}
in `summarise()` you can define as many new columns as you wish. No need to call it for every single variable.
```

```{r, eval = FALSE, solution = TRUE}
ds_dozen %>%
  group_by(dataset) %>%
  summarise(mean_x = mean(x),
            mean_y = mean(y))
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, solution = TRUE}
ds_dozen %>%
  group_by(dataset) %>%
  summarise(mean_x = mean(x),
            mean_y = mean(y)) %>%
  kable()
```


##### Compute both mean and standard deviation (sd) in one go using `across()`


```{r, solution = TRUE}
ds_dozen %>%
  group_by(dataset) %>%
  # across works with first on which columns and second on what to perform on selection
  # 2 possibilities to select columns
  # summarise(across(where(is.double), list(mean = mean, sd = sd)))
  # by default in 1.0.5, grouped variables are excluded from across
  # summarise(across(everything(), list(mean = mean, sd = sd)))
  summarise(across(c(x, y), list(mean = mean, sd = sd)))
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, solution = TRUE}
ds_dozen %>%
  group_by(dataset) %>%
  summarise(across(c(x, y), list(mean = mean, sd = sd))) %>%
  kable()
```


##### What can you conclude?

```{block, solution = TRUE}
all mean and sd are the same for the 13 datasets
```

## Plot the _datasauRus_

##### Plot the `ds_dozen` with `ggplot` such the **aesthetics** are `aes(x = x, y = y)` 
with the **geometry** `geom_point()`

```{block, opts.label = "tip"}
the `ggplot()` and `geom_point()` functions must be linked with a **+** sign
```

```{r, fig.height = 8, fig.asp = 1, solution = TRUE}
ggplot(ds_dozen, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point()
```

##### Reuse the above command, and now colored by the `dataset` column

```{r, fig.height = 8, fig.asp = 1, solution = TRUE}
ggplot(ds_dozen, 
       aes(x = x, 
           y = y, 
           colour = dataset)) +
  geom_point()
```

Too many datasets are displayed.

##### How can we plot only one at a time?

```{block, opts.label = "tip"}
You can filter for one dataset upstream of plotting
```

```{r, solution = TRUE}
ds_dozen %>%
  filter(dataset == "away") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point()
```

##### Adjust the **filtering** step to plot two datasets

```{block, opts.label = "tip"}
R provides the inline instruction `%in%` to test if there a match in the left operand with the right one (a **vector** most probably)
```

```{r, solution = TRUE}
ds_dozen %>%
  filter(dataset %in% c("away", "dino")) %>%
  # alternative without %in% and using OR (|)
  #filter(dataset == "away" | dataset == "dino") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y, colour = dataset)) +
  geom_point()
```

##### Expand now by getting one `dataset` per **facet**

```{r, fig.height = 8, fig.asp = 1, solution = TRUE}
ds_dozen %>%
  filter(dataset %in% c("away", "dino")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y, colour = dataset)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ dataset)
```

##### Remove the filtering step to facet all datasets

```{r, solution = TRUE}
ds_dozen %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y, colour = dataset)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ dataset, ncol = 3)
```


##### Tweak the theme and use the `theme_void` and remove the legend

```{r, fig.height = 8, fig.asp = 1, solution = TRUE}
ggplot(ds_dozen, aes(x = x, y = y, colour = dataset)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_void() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  facet_wrap(~ dataset, ncol = 3)
```

##### Are the datasets actually that similar?

```{block, solution = TRUE}
No ;) We were fooled by the summary stats
```


## Animation

Plots can be animated, see for example what can be done with [`gganimate`](https://gganimate.com/).
Instead of panels, **states** are made across `datasets` and **transitions** smoothed with an afterglow effect.
