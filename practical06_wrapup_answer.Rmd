## Atmospheric carbon dioxide


Carbon dioxide, CO<sub>2</sub> is as its name says, an oxide. Meaning, once in the atmosphere is it extremely stable
and will remain there for thousands of years. Two main carbon sinks exist: forest, mainly trees that incorporate the carbon
 for their growth and oceans. The latter have absorbed approximately half of what humans have produce by burning oil,
 not without consequences. Oceans are getting warmer, making CO<sub>2</sub> solubility weaker and diminishes the pH.
 This acidification already killed half of the animals building coral reef ([91% as in 2022](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/10/devastating-90-of-reefs-surveyed-on-great-barrier-reef-affected-by-coral-bleaching-in-2022)) and calcifying organisms.
 CO<sub>2</sub>, like methane is a greenhouse gas, absorbing and radiating infrared thermal energy 
 leading to heat being trapped close to the ground. 
It is worth saying that the first scientist to discover the link between CO<sub>2</sub> and heat trap was a woman [**Eunice Newton Foote**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eunice_Newton_Foote) as early as 1856. [French version](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eunice_Newton_Foote) of the Wikipedia page is more in line with the [Smithsonian article](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/lady-scientist-helped-revolutionize-climate-science-didnt-get-credit-180961291/): she was not allowed to present her work because of her gender.



##### Find out how long carbon dioxide can last in our atmosphere and why it matters to look at **cumulative** emissions


## Cumulative carbon dioxide emissions

Due to extreme long time CO<sub>2</sub> remains in the atmosphere, looking at yearly emissions is of little interest.
Especially since this is used by rich countries who got rid of most of their industry to justify little efforts.
What matters is the **cumulative** emissions. For this, we will look at the data from the [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.ATM.CO2E.PC).
You will download this data as a ZIP archive (`API_EN.ATM.CO2E.PC_DS2_en_csv_v2_3731558.zip`) that contains 3 CSV.


##### Read the CSV `API_EN.ATM.CO2E.PC_DS2_en_csv_v2_3731558.csv`, assign the name `cum_co2`

```{block, opts.label = "tip"}
- If you look at the file, the first 4 lines are not of interest and should be skipped.
- Column names will be having spaces, leading digits etc... Using `name_repair = "unique"` would help.
- Columns then named `"Country code":"Indicator Code"` can be discarded.
```

```{r}
# Write your answer here
```


##### This dataset is not tidy, why?

```{r}
# Write your answer here
```


##### Pivot accordingly and assign `cum_co2_long`

```{block, opts.label = "tip"}
- Pivot all columns but the identifier of interest: `country_name`
- The `names_to` would make sense to be equal to `year`.
- Transform the names column to integers
```


```{r}
# Write your answer here
```


##### Cleanup by removing the missing values and the year `66`

```{block, opts.label = "tip"}
The first year is 1960, a coherent filtering on the `year` column.
For removing missing values of CO2, `drop_na()` is a good pick
```

```{r}
# Write your answer here
```



##### Plotting Worldwide yearly emissions

```{block, opts.label = "tip"}
- Summarise per year the emissions to have them worldwide.
- Compute the cumulative sum (checkout the `cumsum()` function) of emissions.
- Plot this cumulative sum.
- Add vertical lines for the year 1973, 1979 and 2008. 3 major crisis and comment.
```


```{r}
# Write your answer here
```



```{r}
# Write your answer here
```



##### Using the website [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/economic-growth) load in R their dataset on [economic growth](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/world-gdp-over-the-last-two-millennia?time=1900..2015) as a CSV the World GDP over the last millennia

**GDP** is the main economic indicator and the only target for most countries since WWII.
And this despite a poor indicator (accidents, disasters increase GDP) it is the target.

```{r}
# Write your answer here
```


##### Join `cum_co2_long` and the World GDP per year. Plot this relationship and comment


```{r}
# Write your answer here
```



##### Find the year on which we emitted 50% of all human caused carbon dioxide.

```{r}
# Write your answer here
```


```{r}
# Write your answer here
```


However, one can argue that the emissions data start only in  1960 and are in per-capita units.

Let's explore with another dataset from the famous [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/) organisation

##### Download and open the [CSV CO2 file](https://nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/owid-public/data/co2/owid-co2-data.csv), assign name owid_co2

```{block, opts.label = "tip"}
This file comes already in a data format you can use straight away.
But there are missing values in columns, so pay attention to use the argument `na.rm = TRUE` in your sums.
```

```{r}
owid_co2 <- read_csv("https://r-training.pages.uni.lu/biostat1/projects/data/owid-co2-data.csv",
                     show_col_types = FALSE)
```

##### Using the `co2` column, sum up per year the cumulative emission of carbon dioxide and find out when 50% of emissions were produced

```{block, opts.label = "tip"}
Select directly the "World" as `country` and the cumulative CO2 are also already computed in `cumulative_co2`
```

```{r}
# Write your answer here
```




```{r}
# Write your answer here
```


##### Display the top 10 Carbon dioxide **countries** emitters of all time and comment

```{block, opts.label = "tip"}
The Our World in Data added the calculations for continents and world inside `country`.
to select only individual countries, select only `iso_code` that are **3** characters long.
```

```{r}
owid_co2 |> 
  filter(str_length(iso_code) == 3L) |>
  group_by(country) |> 
  summarise(co2_sum = sum(co2, na.rm = TRUE)) |> 
  slice_max(co2_sum, n = 10) |> 
  mutate(rank = row_number(), .before = 1L)
```


```{r}
# Write your answer here
```

## Appendix {#appendix}

There is too much of fossil energy left to make our climate livable. 
The carbon dioxide concentration has never been that high as today since 800,000 years.
Thus, all the humankind history has lived in lower concentrations, the new era is then an unknown territory.
However, as seen in [Delannoy et al. 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261921011673?via%3Dihub), in _Applied Energy_ 
 there is not enough fossil for continuing our current life style, and for lower income countries to reach it.
